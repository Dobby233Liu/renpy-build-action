# Build Ren'Py Project

This GitHub action allows you to make distributable builds of a Ren'Py visual novel project in a workflow and use the built files for distribution.

## Usage

```yml
- name: Build VN project
  uses: ProjectAliceDev/renpy-build-action@master
  with:
    sdk-version: '6.99.12.4'
    project-dir: '.'
  env:
    SDL_AUDIODRIVER: dummy
    SDL_VIDEODRIVER: dummy
```

## Required parameters

- `sdk-version`: The version of the Ren'Py SDK to use while building. Will default to `7.3.5` if none is found.

- `project-dir`: The directory where the project exists. Will default to `'.'` (root) if none is found.

### Outputs

- `dir`: The directory where the files were built to.
- `version`: The name of the project and version that was built. Often useful in cases where you don't know the version.
